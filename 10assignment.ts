//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written,
// and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific 
//to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your 
//name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one 
//sentence describing what the program does.

//1. add comment 
//Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, 
//create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

//Name: KAVITA
//  Date: 
var FavNum:number = 7
console.log(FavNum + " because it shows the quantity of my family members")
// 7: number is my most favorite numbers because it shows the quantity of my family members and
// it my lucky number. THIS IS THE REASON.
//and u say what program does
//first we make a variable for storing the data,
// variable is act like a container it stores every type of data like
// string, number,boolean(these are the data type actually these are called primitive data type)
//then anything we have to print then we write console.log() then we get result otherwise we don't 
// write console.log() then we cant get results 


//2. // Stripping Names: Store a person’s name,
// and include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
//and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", 
//at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

// Name: kavita
//Date: 
var name5 = "\t kavita /n"
console.log("Nmae With White Space: " + name5)
var name5 = "kavita"
console.log("Name Without White space: " + name5)
//when we write white space character we must have to write "\t" and '/n"
//otherwise we do not write these character then we cant get white space
